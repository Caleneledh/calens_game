This is my fork of the infrastructure mod. It's essentially aimed at servers running webdesigner97's streetsmod that want stuff from infrastructure too (dreambuilder_game in particular), and is intended to add on to streetsmod instead of replacing it.

Originally based on Streets by webdesigner97
Modified by Ragnarok/Vibender
Modified again by cheapie

Depends: default, moreblocks, mesecons, technic, streetsmod
